# stratigos-atom theme

This is a dark theme that uses a wide variety of colors with high contrasting text to emphasize keywords and make code pop out. It is not colored for style or prettiness :-D.

This theme began as a TextMate theme, circa 2008, and was mostly tailored for Object Oriented PHP5. I haven't worked with PHP in a few years, so it has not received further development for PHP7.

It has been converted into a Sublime 2/3 theme, and modified along the way to accomodate Ruby syntax. I mostly work with Ruby/Rails these days, and the rules I have for Ruby syntax seem to apply well elsewhere (for other languages). 

Its latest iteration is a conversion into an Atom package, still Ruby centric, though I expect it to evolve to fine tune colors for ES6 JS and JSX, and Elixir. 

**Dark theme the entire web! Save your eyes, your screen, and the world's energy bill.**
